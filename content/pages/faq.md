# Frequently Asked Questions

## "We don't have much budget for analytics"
That's exactly why the fractional model works - you get dedicated expertise without full-time costs. We can start small with immediate value and grow the partnership as it makes sense for your budget.

## "Our data is probably a mess"
Most organizations feel that way, and it's rarely as bad as it seems. Part of what we help with is understanding what you actually have, what's worth focusing on first, and creating order without overwhelming your team.

## "We tried analytics before and it didn't work"
That experience is actually valuable information! Understanding what didn't work helps us design something that will. Often the difference is in the ongoing support and iterative approach rather than the technology itself.

## "We don't really know what we need"
That's the perfect place to start. Figuring out what would be most valuable is often the most important part of the process. We can explore that together without any pressure to have answers upfront.

## "How do we know if we need a data warehouse or complex infrastructure?"
Great question. If you're running manual reports daily and losing productivity, or have many data sources that need integration, it might be time. If you pull one report monthly that takes a couple hours, maybe not yet. We can assess this together based on your specific situation.

## "What makes fractional partnership different from regular consulting?"
Traditional consultants deliver a project and move on. Fractional partnership means I'm available month after month, learning your business deeply, seeing how solutions work in practice, and adjusting as needed. It's the difference between getting a report and building lasting capability.

## "How long do partnerships typically last?"
It varies based on your needs and goals. Some organizations work with us for specific projects (6-12 months), others maintain ongoing partnerships for years. The model is designed to be flexible - scale up when you need more support, scale down when you're more self-sufficient.

## "Do you work with organizations outside your local area?"
Yes, I work with organizations across the country. Much of the work can be done remotely, with periodic in-person visits when helpful for relationship-building and training.
