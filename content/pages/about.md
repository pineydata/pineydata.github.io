# My Background

I've spent over a decade building analytics capabilities from the ground up at organizations like Shopify, University of Iowa, and Transamerica - work that's earned national recognition through business journals, speaking invitations, and industry awards. But what drives me isn't just the technical challenge - it's using data to amplify mission-driven work.

My path keeps leading me back to organizations focused on making a difference. I started as an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer building community capacity, went to grad school planning to become a teacher, and then realized I love diving into problems and figuring out solutions. Analytics turned out to be something I'm really good at that scratches that itch perfectly.

I've worked across different sectors - from financial services at Shopify to fundraising analytics in higher education to risk management at Transamerica - which gives me a broad toolkit for solving the unique challenges mission-driven organizations face.

As a former educator and VISTA volunteer, I love the intensive mentorship aspect of this work - seeing teams go from "we don't know what we don't know" to "we can see exactly what we need to do next."
